# Sazim Ruby on Rails Assessment Template

[Here](https://github.com/SazimAssessments/sazim-backend-rails-assessment-starter) is a starter repository to fork off of. You are open to using it and you are also welcome to add some gems (like authentication/authorization or background job runner) if you are more familiar with other gems.

## **Installation**

Ensure that ruby version **3.3.4** is installed in your system. Then, install the gems by running:

```
bundle install
```

## **Run The Server**

Start the server with:

```
rails s
```

To run the tests, use:

```
rails test
```

For automatic code corrections, execute:

```
rubocop -A
```
